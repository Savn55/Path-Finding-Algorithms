## Implementation of A* algorithm for Romania city Map 
## Following algorithm can be implemented with modification of funcitons 
-  "Breadth First Tree Search",
   "Depth First Tree Search",
   "Breadth First Search",
   "Depth First Graph Search",
   "Best First Graph Search",
   "Uniform Cost Search",
   "Depth Limited Search",
   "Iterative Deepening Search",
   "Greedy Best First Search",
   "A-star Search",
   "Recursive Best First Search"})
   
## Visualization of A* algorithm using 
- matplotlib
- networks (for graphs)
- ipywidgets interact (for funcitons parameters)
